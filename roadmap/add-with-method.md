## With method âœ… IMPLEMENTED

In normal v3 livewire components there is a render method that returns a view instance.

People often attach extra data that they want to be available inside the view like so:

```php
public function render()
{
    return view('livewire.foo', [
        'foo' => 'bar',
    ]);
}
```

However, with the new single-file component syntax people don't have a render method because the view is the file itself, as a side effect they don't have a place to pass bespoke variables into the view.

Let me propose a `with()` method that is simply run to add extra scope to a component's render.

Here's how a user would use such a thing:

```php
@php
new class extends \Livewire\Component
{
    //

    public function with()
    {
        return [
            'foo' => 'bar',
        ];
    }
}
@endphp

<div>{{ $foo }}</div>
```

### Implementation

The implementation has been completed and follows this pattern:

**Location:** `src/V4/WithMethod/SupportWithMethod.php`

**How it works:**
1. A `ComponentHook` called `SupportWithMethod` intercepts the render process
2. During the `render` hook, it checks if the component has a `with()` method
3. If present, it calls the method and expects an array return value
4. The returned data is merged with the view using `$view->with($withData)`
5. This makes all variables from the `with()` method available in the template

**Key features:**
- Only runs if a `with()` method exists (no performance impact otherwise)
- Validates that `with()` returns an array (ignores non-array returns)
- Variables from `with()` take precedence over component properties
- Integrates seamlessly with existing Livewire functionality

**Registration:**
The feature is registered in `LivewireServiceProvider::bootFeatures()` alongside other V4 features:
```php
\Livewire\V4\WithMethod\SupportWithMethod::class,
```

**Testing:**
Comprehensive tests ensure:
- Basic functionality works
- Components without `with()` method work normally
- Invalid return types are handled gracefully
- Data precedence works correctly (with() overrides properties)

**Example usage:**
```php
@php
new class extends \Livewire\Component
{
    public $name = 'World';

    public function with()
    {
        return [
            'greeting' => 'Hello',
            'timestamp' => now()->format('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
            'computed_value' => $this->someExpensiveCalculation(),
        ];
    }

    private function someExpensiveCalculation()
    {
        // Some complex logic here
        return 'computed result';
    }
}
@endphp

<div>
    <h1>{{ $greeting }}, {{ $name }}!</h1>
    <p>Time: {{ $timestamp }}</p>
    <p>Result: {{ $computed_value }}</p>
</div>
```

This solution provides a clean, Laravel-like API for passing additional data to single-file component views, maintaining consistency with traditional Livewire component patterns while being optimized for the new V4 architecture.
