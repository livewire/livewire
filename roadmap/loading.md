## Ideas
- data-loading attribute on an element that originates a request (ie `wire:model` input)
- if there is a component level action, shouldn't add to the root element
- data-global-loading for component or page level
- easy to target an outter or sibling element to see if it has loading attribute on it
- submit - should it have `data-loading`? That will trigger all within it
- all elements that trigger events get annotated rather than element that is listening for it
- e.target - add `data-loading` - `wire:change` on a div, should it be on a div
- does a submit button in a form show up in the event? Just add it to the submit button
- make it `data-wire-loading`
- `wire:target="$dispatch('foo')"` any magics should work somehow
- the triggering element and it's directive expression
- make an action for `$dispatch()` and then it can be `wire:target`
