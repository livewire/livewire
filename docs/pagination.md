Laravel's pagination feature allows you to query a subset of data and provides your users with the ability to navigate between *pages* of those results.

Because Laravel's paginator was designed for static applications, in a non-Livewire app, each page navigation triggers a full browser visit to a new URL containing the desired page (`?page=2`).

However, when you use pagination inside a Livewire component, users can navigate between pages while remaining on the same page. Livewire will handle everything behind the scenes, including updating the URL query string with the current page.

## Basic usage

Below is the most basic example of using pagination inside a `ShowPosts` component to only show ten posts at a time:

> [!warning] You must use the `WithPagination` trait
> To take advantage of Livewire's pagination features, each component containing pagination must use the `Livewire\WithPagination` trait.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Livewire;

use Livewire\WithPagination;
use Livewire\Component;
use App\Models\Post;

class ShowPosts extends Component
{
    use WithPagination;

    public function render()
    {
        return view('show-posts', [
            'posts' => Post::paginate(10),
        ]);
    }
}
```

```blade
<div>
    <div>
        @foreach ($posts as $post)
            <!-- ... -->
        @endforeach
    </div>

    {{ $posts->links() }}
</div>
```

As you can see, in addition to limiting the number of posts shown via the `Post::paginate()` method, we will also use `$posts->links()` to render page navigation links.

For more information on pagination using Laravel, check out [Laravel's comprehensive pagination documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/pagination).

## Disabling URL query string tracking

By default, Livewire's paginator tracks the current page in the browser URL's query string like so: `?page=2`.

If you wish to still use Livewire's pagination utility, but disable query string tracking, you can do so using the `WithoutUrlPagination` trait:

```php
use Livewire\WithoutUrlPagination;
use Livewire\WithPagination;
use Livewire\Component;

class ShowPosts extends Component
{
    use WithPagination, WithoutUrlPagination; // [tl! highlight]

    // ...
}
```

Now, pagination will work as expected, but the current page won't show up in the query string. This also means the current page won't be persisted across page changes.

## Customizing scroll behavior

By default, Livewire's paginator scrolls to the top of the page after every page change.

You can disable this behavior by passing `false` to the `scrollTo` parameter of the `links()` method like so:

```blade
{{ $posts->links(data: ['scrollTo' => false]) }}
```

Alternatively, you can provide any CSS selector to the `scrollTo` parameter, and Livewire will find the nearest element matching that selector and scroll to it after each navigation:

```blade
{{ $posts->links(data: ['scrollTo' => '#paginated-posts']) }}
```

## Resetting the page

When sorting or filtering results, it is common to want to reset the page number back to `1`.

For this reason, Livewire provides the `$this->resetPage()` method, allowing you to reset the page number from anywhere in your component.

The following component demonstrates using this method to reset the page after the search form is submitted:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Livewire;

use Livewire\WithPagination;
use Livewire\Component;
use App\Models\Post;

class SearchPosts extends Component
{
    use WithPagination;

    public $query = '';

    public function search()
    {
        $this->resetPage();
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return view('show-posts', [
            'posts' => Post::where('title', 'like', '%'.$this->query.'%')->paginate(10),
        ]);
    }
}
```

```blade
<div>
    <form wire:submit="search">
        <input type="text" wire:model="query">

        <button type="submit">Search posts</button>
    </form>

    <div>
        @foreach ($posts as $post)
            <!-- ... -->
        @endforeach
    </div>

    {{ $posts->links() }}
</div>
```

Now, if a user was on page `5` of the results and then filtered the results further by pressing "Search posts", the page would be reset back to `1`.

### Available page navigation methods

In addition to `$this->resetPage()`, Livewire provides other useful methods for navigating between pages programmatically from your component:

| Method        | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `$this->setPage($page)`    | Set the paginator to a specific page number |
| `$this->resetPage()`    | Reset the page back to 1 |
| `$this->nextPage()`    | Go to the next page |
| `$this->previousPage()`    | Go to the previous page |

## Multiple paginators

Because both Laravel and Livewire use URL query string parameters to store and track the current page number, if a single page contains multiple paginators, it's important to assign them different names.

To demonstrate the problem more clearly, consider the following `ShowClients` component:

```php
use Livewire\WithPagination;
use Livewire\Component;
use App\Models\Client;

class ShowClients extends Component
{
    use WithPagination;

    public function render()
    {
        return view('show-clients', [
            'clients' => Client::paginate(10),
        ]);
    }
}
```

As you can see, the above component contains a paginated set of *clients*. If a user were to navigate to page `2` of this result set, the URL might look like the following:

```
http://application.test/?page=2
```

Suppose the page also contains a `ShowInvoices` component that also uses pagination. To independently track each paginator's current page, you need to specify a name for the second paginator like so:

```php
use Livewire\WithPagination;
use Livewire\Component;
use App\Models\Invoices;

class ShowInvoices extends Component
{
    use WithPagination;

    public function render()
    {
        return view('show-invoices', [
            'invoices' => Invoice::paginate(10, pageName: 'invoices-page'),
        ]);
    }
}
```

Now, because of the `pageName` parameter that has been added to the `paginate` method, when a user visits page `2` of the *invoices*, the URL will contain the following:

```
https://application.test/customers?page=2&invoices-page=2
```

When using Livewire's page navigation methods on a named paginator, you must provide the page name as an additional parameter:

```php
$this->setPage(2, pageName: 'invoices-page');

$this->resetPage(pageName: 'invoices-page');

$this->nextPage(pageName: 'invoices-page');

$this->previousPage(pageName: 'invoices-page');
```

## Hooking into page updates

Livewire allows you to execute code before and after a page is updated by defining either of the following methods inside your component:

```php
use Livewire\WithPagination;

class ShowPosts extends Component
{
    use WithPagination;

    public function updatingPage($page)
    {
        // Runs before the page is updated for this component...
    }

    public function updatedPage($page)
    {
        // Runs after the page is updated for this component...
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return view('show-posts', [
            'posts' => Post::paginate(10),
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Named paginator hooks

The previous hooks only apply to the default paginator. If you are using a named paginator, you must define the methods using the paginator's name.

For example, below is an example of what a hook for a paginator named `invoices-page` would look like:

```php
public function updatingInvoicesPage($page)
{
    //
}
```

### General paginator hooks

If you prefer to not reference the paginator name in the hook method name, you can use the more generic alternatives and simply receive the `$pageName` as a second argument to the hook method:

```php
public function updatingPaginators($page, $pageName)
{
    // Runs before the page is updated for this component...
}

public function updatedPaginators($page, $pageName)
{
    // Runs after the page is updated for this component...
}
```

## Using the simple theme

You can use Laravel's `simplePaginate()` method instead of `paginate()` for added speed and simplicity.

When paginating results using this method, only *next* and *previous* navigation links will be shown to the user instead of individual links for each page number:

```php
public function render()
{
    return view('show-posts', [
        'posts' => Post::simplePaginate(10),
    ]);
}
```

For more information on simple pagination, check out [Laravel's "simplePaginator" documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/pagination#simple-pagination).

## Using cursor pagination

Livewire also supports using Laravel's cursor pagination â€” a faster pagination method useful in large datasets:

```php
public function render()
{
    return view('show-posts', [
        'posts' => Post::cursorPaginate(10),
    ]);
}
```

By using `cursorPaginate()` instead of `paginate()` or `simplePaginate()`, the query string in your application's URL will store an encoded *cursor* instead of a standard page number. For example:

```
https://example.com/posts?cursor=eyJpZCI6MTUsIl9wb2ludHNUb05leHRJdGVtcyI6dHJ1ZX0
```

For more information on cursor pagination, check out [Laravel's cursor pagination documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/pagination#cursor-pagination).

## Using Bootstrap instead of Tailwind

If you are using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) instead of [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as your application's CSS framework, you can configure Livewire to use Bootstrap styled pagination views instead of the default Tailwind views.

To accomplish this, set the `pagination_theme` configuration value in your application's `config/livewire.php` file:

```php
'pagination_theme' => 'bootstrap',
```

> [!info] Publishing Livewire's configuration file
> Before customizing the pagination theme, you must first publish Livewire's configuration file to your application's `/config` directory by running the following command:
> ```shell
> php artisan livewire:publish --config
> ```

## Modifying the default pagination views

If you want to modify Livewire's pagination views to fit your application's style, you can do so by *publishing* them using the following command:

```shell
php artisan livewire:publish --pagination
```

After running this command, the following four files will be inserted into the `resources/views/vendor/livewire` directory:

| View file name        | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `tailwind.blade.php`    | The standard Tailwind pagination theme |
| `tailwind-simple.blade.php`    | The *simple* Tailwind pagination theme |
| `bootstrap.blade.php`    | The standard Bootstrap pagination theme |
| `bootstrap-simple.blade.php`    | The *simple* Bootstrap pagination theme |

Once the files have been published, you have complete control over them. When rendering pagination links using the paginated result's `->links()` method inside your template, Livewire will use these files instead of its own.

## Using custom pagination views

If you wish to bypass Livewire's pagination views entirely, you can render your own in one of two ways:

1. The `->links()` method in your Blade view
2. The `paginationView()` or `paginationSimpleView()` method in your component

### Via `->links()`

The first approach is to simply pass your custom pagination Blade view name to the `->links()` method directly:

```blade
{{ $posts->links('custom-pagination-links') }}
```

When rendering the pagination links, Livewire will now look for a view at `resources/views/custom-pagination-links.blade.php`.

### Via `paginationView()` or `paginationSimpleView()`

The second approach is to declare a `paginationView` or `paginationSimpleView` method inside your component which returns the name of the view you would like to use:

```php
public function paginationView()
{
    return 'custom-pagination-links-view';
}

public function paginationSimpleView()
{
    return 'custom-simple-pagination-links-view';
}
```

### Sample pagination view

Below is an unstyled sample of a simple Livewire pagination view for your reference.

As you can see, you can use Livewire's page navigation helpers like `$this->nextPage()` directly inside your template by adding `wire:click="nextPage"` to buttons:

```blade
<div>
    @if ($paginator->hasPages())
        <nav role="navigation" aria-label="Pagination Navigation">
            <span>
                @if ($paginator->onFirstPage())
                    <span>Previous</span>
                @else
                    <button wire:click="previousPage" wire:loading.attr="disabled" rel="prev">Previous</button>
                @endif
            </span>

            <span>
                @if ($paginator->onLastPage())
                    <span>Next</span>
                @else
                    <button wire:click="nextPage" wire:loading.attr="disabled" rel="next">Next</button>
                @endif
            </span>
        </nav>
    @endif
</div>
```
