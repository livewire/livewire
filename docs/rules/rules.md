> When do you start a file with "< ?php"

> Always use tailwind in examples?  

> Use active voice.

> Use second-person singular ("You")

> Sometimes you can introduce a concept with first-person plural ("We") and switch to "You" when giving step-by-step instructions

> Always include import statements 

> Be consistent, but switch it up (tone, filler transition text, using colons)

> Optimize for skimming (don't show "wrong" example first unless you have visual aid. People ain't reading the words: this is wrong up-front)
